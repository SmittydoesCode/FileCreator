# FileCreator
I am learning python and I wanted to create a file creator where a user could make a set amount of files quickly. 
You can also create one file at a time. 
In the middle of coding FileCreator.py, I realized that you can perform all the actions that i needed in one function.
I re-wrote it and now am publishing it here. Please tell me your thoughts!
